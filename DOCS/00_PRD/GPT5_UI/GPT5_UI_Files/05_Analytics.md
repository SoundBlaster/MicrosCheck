# 5. Analytics Specification

## Overview

This document defines the analytics events, payload structures, telemetry integration guidelines, and success criteria for the GPT5_UI application. Analytics are an optional feature implemented behind a stub protocol to allow enable/disable without impacting core functionality.

The purpose of analytics is to enable monitoring of user interactions, session activity, and UI state changes to facilitate usability studies, issue diagnostics, and performance tuning.

## Analytics Events

### Recording Lifecycle Events

| Event Name | Description                              | Trigger Condition                              |
|------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| rec_start  | Recording session initiated.             | User starts a new recording session.          |
| rec_pause  | Recording session paused.                 | User pauses ongoing recording.                  |
| rec_resume | Recording session resumed.                | User resumes a paused recording.                |
| rec_stop   | Recording session stopped.                | User stops and finalizes the recording session.|

### Marker and Loop Events

| Event Name | Description                            | Trigger Condition                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| mark_add   | User adds a bookmark (T-MARK).        | A bookmark is placed during recording/playback.|
| ab_set     | A-B loop points set or updated.        | User defines or modifies A and B loop points.  |
| ab_clear   | Clears A-B loop points.                 | User disables A-B loop playback.                |

### UI Interaction Events

| Event Name   | Description                              | Trigger Condition                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| seek         | Playback or recording position changed. | User seeks to a different playback position.   |
| dpc_change   | Display playback controls change.       | User toggles display options, e.g., meters.    |
| lock_toggle  | UI locking/unlocking toggled.            | User locks or unlocks the UI controls.          |

## Payload Definitions

Each event may be accompanied by an optional payload carrying contextual data. Payload keys and value types are standardized as follows:

| Key       | Data Type | Description                                         |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| timestamp | ISO 8601 string | Exact UTC time when the event occurred.        |
| position  | Float (seconds) | Current playback or recording position in seconds. |
| rate      | Float      | Playback or recording rate (1.0 = normal speed).  |
| file_id   | String     | Unique identifier for the active audio file/session.|

## Integration and Implementation Notes

- All analytics events shall be sent asynchronously to a telemetry backend or logged locally as per configuration.
- The telemetry solution must support batching, retries on failure, and offline caching.
- Privacy and security considerations must be applied to avoid capturing PII or sensitive data.
- Analytics must not interfere with the UI responsiveness or audio processing latency.
- The analytics module will be behind a feature flag to allow runtime enable/disable.
- Event sending frequency should be optimized to balance real-time monitoring needs with bandwidth and power consumption constraints.

## Success Criteria

- Analytics are implemented for all the events listed above with full payload data accuracy.
- Event delivery success rate is â‰¥ 99% under normal network conditions.
- There is no measurable impact on UI latency or recording quality due to analytics.
- The telemetry backend ingestion pipeline is capable of processing all generated events without loss.
- Documented test scenarios cover event triggering, payload formation, error handling, and offline resilience.
- Analytics can be disabled without causing errors or resource leaks.

## Extensibility

- The analytics framework shall provide a pluggable event dispatcher to support multiple telemetry providers.
- Event schema versioning must be supported to accommodate future modifications.
- New events and payload fields should be added following the same naming and typing conventions.
