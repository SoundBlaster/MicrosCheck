- Settings Sheet (from OPTION):
  - Recording format presets; pre-roll toggle; DPC cycle list; theme (system/light/dark).
- Error Banner/Toast component (reusable).
- Permission Explainer Sheet (post-denial).
- Theming tokens (spacing, radius, typography).
- Haptics service, Analytics service protocols.
- Preview Providers with deterministic mocks & fixtures (golden levels/wave chunks).
- Localization infrastructure.
