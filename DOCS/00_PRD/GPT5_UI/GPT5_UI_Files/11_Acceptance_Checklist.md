# 11. Acceptance Checklist for GPT5 UI Components

This checklist ensures that all required features, quality gates, and performance metrics have been met before submission and integration. Each item corresponds to explicit success criteria and verification methodologies described in the overall PRD.

---

## 1. Protocols and Mocks Implementation

- [ ] All global contracts and protocols for components are implemented as defined ([ref: 01_Global_Contracts_for_all_Components]).
- [ ] Deterministic mock objects and fixtures exist to support isolated testing and preview providers.
- [ ] Mocks allow reproducible state and event streams matching production data interfaces.

### Verification
- Unit tests cover protocol conformance.
- Mocks are used in UI previews and snapshot tests.

---

## 2. SwiftUI View Composition and Integration

- [ ] `RecorderScreen` root view composed from all child views A1 through A7.
- [ ] Each child view accepts immutable props and communicates via callbacks only.
- [ ] View hierarchy matches the specified design and layout constraints.
- [ ] Accessibility annotations and dynamic type support are fully integrated.

### Verification
- Snapshot tests cover all views in light and dark modes.
- Accessibility inspected with VoiceOver and dynamic type scaling.

---

## 3. ViewModel Binding and Interaction

- [ ] ViewModel adapts all `RecordingEngine` outputs to view props correctly.
- [ ] All user interaction intents from views are wired through ViewModel to the recording engine logic.
- [ ] ViewModel executes on @MainActor to ensure thread safety.
- [ ] UI refreshes meet update rate of ≥20 Hz with latency ≤100 ms.

### Verification
- Integration tests validate event flow from UI to recording engine and back.
- Performance metrics logged and reviewed.

---

## 4. Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] Unit, integration, and snapshot tests are implemented and pass successfully.
- [ ] Test coverage includes functional behavior, visual layouts, and performance criteria as per Sections 6–7.
- [ ] CI pipeline executes all tests and reports green status.

### Verification
- Code coverage reports reviewed.
- CI logs confirm no failures.

---

## 5. Accessibility Compliance

- [ ] All interactive controls have VoiceOver labels and hints.
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 standard of 4.5:1.
- [ ] Dynamic type scales from L to XXL without layout breakage.
- [ ] Keyboard and assistive navigation flows are tested.

### Verification
- Manual testing with VoiceOver and accessibility inspector tools.
- Automated accessibility audits where applicable.

---

## 6. Theming and Visual Consistency

- [ ] Supports both light and dark modes per system or user override.
- [ ] Snapshot tests match baseline images for all major UI states.
- [ ] Theming tokens for spacing, radius, and typography are correctly applied.

### Verification
- Snapshot tests reviewed in CI.
- Manual visual inspection on multiple device simulators.

---

## 7. Performance and Resource Usage

- [ ] Continuous UI updates maintain ≥20 Hz refresh rate.
- [ ] UI latency from microphone input to visual meter update is ≤100 ms.
- [ ] Background recording energy consumption does not exceed prescribed limits.
- [ ] No memory leaks or main thread blocking detected.

### Verification
- Profiling tools confirm performance targets.
- Battery usage measurement during extended background recording.

---

## 8. Error Handling and Permissions

- [ ] Error banner/toast component displays correctly with dismissible and accessible UI.
- [ ] Permission explainer sheet triggers post-denial with appropriate messaging.
- [ ] Error and permission UI flows tested under edge cases and repeated denial scenarios.

### Verification
- UI tests simulate error conditions.
- Manual permission denial and recovery tested on device.

---

## Final Sign-off

- [ ] All items above completed and verified.
- [ ] Project ready for submission and further integration.
