# 10. UX Details Considering SPECIAL DESIGN

- Skeuomorphism, resemblance to a real device
- Palette — dark, with contrasting accents; round buttons, large “STOP/REC”.
- L/R meters: double bars (average power and peak), labels in dB (for example `-7 dB / -21 dB`).
- Top time ruler with marks and a red cursor.
- Lock at the bottom left — toggles overlay (semi-transparent layer with the hint “Hold to unlock for 2s”).
- Icon `i` — modal “About the App” + gesture guide.
- Haptic feedback: start/stop recording, setting A/B, placing T-MARK.
