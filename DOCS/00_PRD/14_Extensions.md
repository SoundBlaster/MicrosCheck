# 14. Extensions (after 1.0)

## Baseline File Export (1.0)

- **Share Sheet Export:** In version 1.0, users can export audio files via the standard iOS Share Sheet, enabling sharing to other apps (Mail, Messages, Files, Drive, etc.).
- **Export Format:** The default and only export format for 1.0 is AAC (.m4a). MP3 export is not available in 1.0 but is planned for a future update (see below).
- **Metadata Included:** The exported payload provides the original filename, file duration, and creation date as part of the file's metadata where supported by the destination (e.g., Files app will display these).
- **How to Export:** Users select 'Export' from the Option sheet in the UI, which invokes the system Share Sheet for the chosen file.

- Export to MP3: Planned for a future update to provide more format options. (Note: MP3 export is not available in version 1.0; only AAC/.m4a is supported initially.)
- iCloud Drive Integration: Later versions will allow direct saving and retrieving from iCloud Drive.
- Metadata Enhancement: Future updates will expand metadata tagging capabilities beyond the baseline.
