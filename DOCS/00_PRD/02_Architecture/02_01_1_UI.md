# UI (SwiftUI)

- Implements all screens and controls using SwiftUI, strictly adhering to the provided design for pixel-perfect consistency and accessibility.
- Modular, composable SwiftUI views reflect key app features: Record, Play, File Manager, Toolbar, D-Pad, Waveform, Info Card, Quick Actions, and more (see UI Map).
- Navigation and user flows are handled via enum-based router and Sheets for clarity and simplicity.
- Employs modern SwiftUI APIs, including the `#Preview` macro for robust previewing, and accessibility modifiers for inclusive design.
- Delegates state management and event handling to ViewModels, keeping view code declarative and free of business logic.
- Focuses on efficient rendering, smooth transitions, and an intuitive user experience throughout.
