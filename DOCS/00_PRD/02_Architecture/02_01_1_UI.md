# 2.1.1 UI/UX Detail & Design System (Expanded Requirements)

- **Animation Requirements**:
  - Waveform must update smoothly and responsively during recording and playback, reflecting real-time changes in the audio.
  - Button state transitions (e.g., REC → PAUSE → RESUME → STOP) must be animated to provide clear visual feedback (e.g., fade, scale, or color transitions).
  - Lock/unlock overlay should animate in/out to reinforce state changes and prevent accidental input, with a brief fade or slide effect.
- **UI State Enumeration**:
  - All interactive controls (REC/PAUSE/RESUME/STOP, A/B loop, lock/unlock) must explicitly define their visual and interactive states, including disabled/inactive, active, and transitioning.
  - Toolbar and quick action buttons must reflect their selection/active state visually.
- **Design System Adherence**:
  - All UI components strictly adhere to the app's design system, including:
    - **Color palette**: Use defined primary/secondary/background colors, with accessible contrast ratios.
    - **Typography**: Apply consistent font styles and weights per design spec (e.g., headings, labels, captions).
    - **Spacing rules**: Maintain consistent padding, margin, and layout grid across screens/components.
    - **Iconography**: Use a coherent icon set; icons must scale cleanly and remain legible at all sizes.
  - Accessibility modifiers must be applied consistently for all controls (labels, values, hints).
