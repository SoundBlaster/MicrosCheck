# Audio Session
- Utilizes `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord` for seamless record/playback.
- Uses `.spokenAudio` or `.default` mode, allowing Bluetooth, default-to-speaker, and mix with others options.
- Handles interruptions (e.g., calls), route changes, and remote control events.
- Audio session settings are configurable and managed centrally.
