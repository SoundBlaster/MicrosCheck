# 15. Release Plan (estimate)

- **Sprint 1 (1.5–2 weeks):** R1–R4, FM1–FM2, UI1 (main screen without DPC/A‑B), basic player P1–P3.
- **Sprint 2 (1.5 weeks):** P4–P7, UI2, BM1, ST1, SEC1.
- **Sprint 3 (1 week):** UI3, FM3–FM4, QA1–QA2, polishing, App Store checklist.

Total: ~4–5 weeks for 1.0 by a team of 1 iOS developer.

- A dedicated period for Stress/QA (covering long recordings, battery drain, disk space exhaustion, and large library scenarios) is included in the release deliverables, and its completion is a requirement for final release. This aligns with the QA and stress requirements detailed earlier in the PRD and NFR.
