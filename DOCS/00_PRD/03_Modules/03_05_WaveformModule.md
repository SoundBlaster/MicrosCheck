# 5. WaveformModule (Backend, Planned)

### Overview
The WaveformModule provides backend services for generating, caching, and supplying audio waveform data for UI rendering. It supports both live waveform sampling during recording or playback and offline waveform data generation for efficient large file preview.

### Responsibilities

- **Live Waveform Rendering:** Samples audio data buffers in real time to produce waveform metrics such as RMS and peak amplitudes for smooth UI visualization.
- **Offline Waveform Generation:** Processes full audio files offline to create waveform preview data, enabling fast loading and scrolling of waveform views in the UI.
- **Waveform Caching:** Stores generated waveform data in a cache (e.g., `.wave` files in a local format) to optimize performance and reduce redundant processing.
- **Custom Rendering Support:** Provides configurable waveform parameters including color schemes, zoom levels, scaling modes, and display styles to match app themes and user preferences.
- **Performance Optimization:** Utilizes efficient algorithms and hardware acceleration where possible to ensure minimal CPU and memory usage during waveform computation and rendering.
- **Error Handling:** Detects waveform generation failures or cache corruption and supports recovery or regeneration to maintain app stability.

### APIs and Protocols

- Defines interfaces to query waveform data for given audio files, including loading cached waveform previews or triggering offline generation.
- Exposes delegate or callback mechanisms for notifying completion of waveform generation or updates.
- Provides live sampling APIs for integration with audio engines during recording and playback.

### Integration Notes

- The WaveformModule operates independently of UI rendering, focusing solely on waveform data generation and supply.
- Frontend UI components consume waveform data to render visual waveforms using SwiftUI Canvas, Metal, or other graphics frameworks.
- Works closely with PlayerModule and RecorderModule to access live audio buffers for real-time waveform sampling.
- Designed for extensibility to incorporate advanced waveform analysis or new rendering techniques in future iterations.

# Summary

The WaveformModule backend is a critical component for delivering responsive, visually rich audio waveform displays. By separating waveform data generation from UI rendering, it creates a modular architecture that maintains performance and scalability even with large audio libraries or long-duration recordings.

UI components interact with this backend module to retrieve waveform metrics for visualization, enabling seamless and performant user experiences across recording and playback scenarios.
