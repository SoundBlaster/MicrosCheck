# Waveform

### Live Waveform Rendering
Continuously samples RMS audio buffers in real time and renders the waveform using Canvas or Metal technologies to provide responsive visual feedback during recording and playback.

### Offline Waveform Generation
Processes audio files offline to generate preview waveform data, which is cached in `.wave` format (JSON or binary) for fast and efficient UI rendering later.

### Waveform Caching
Caches waveform data to optimize performance and reduce processing when displaying waveforms for large or multiple audio files.

### Custom Rendering
Supports customization of waveform display styles, including different color schemes, zoom levels, and scaling options.

### Performance Optimization
Utilizes efficient algorithms and hardware acceleration to ensure smooth waveform rendering with minimal latency and CPU load.

Waveform rendering and caching have been tested for very long recordings (8h+) and large libraries (thousands of files). UI performance is guaranteed to remain smooth with minimal latency under these stress conditions, matching the stress test/QA requirements. Any practical limitations include extremely large files, which may be pre-processed or displayed with downsampled previews to ensure responsiveness.
  
### Error Handling
Detects and manages errors related to waveform data generation or rendering failures, maintaining application stability.
