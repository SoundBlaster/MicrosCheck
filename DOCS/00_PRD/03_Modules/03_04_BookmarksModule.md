# 4. BookmarksModule (Backend, Planned)

### Overview
The BookmarksModule provides backend services to manage timestamped bookmarks within audio recordings. It enables quick marking, detailed annotations, persistence, retrieval, and sharing of bookmark data.

### Responsibilities

- **Quick Marking:** Allows users to instantly add a timestamped bookmark during playback or recording with minimal interaction.
- **Bookmark Details:** Supports assigning titles, notes, or comments to bookmarks for richer annotation.
- **Bookmark Listing and Navigation:** Provides APIs to list all bookmarks associated with a recording and enables navigation/jumping to bookmarked positions.
- **Persistence:** Saves bookmarks in the recording's associated metadata files to ensure bookmarks persist across app launches and file reloads.
- **Editing and Deletion:** Supports modifying and deleting individual bookmarks as part of user file management.
- **Export and Sharing:** Facilitates exporting bookmarks and their associated notes for sharing with other apps or backing up data.

### APIs and Protocols

- Defines a `Bookmark` data model with properties such as unique identifier, timestamp, title, note, and creation date.
- Exposes protocols for adding, retrieving, updating, and removing bookmarks in an abstract manner.
- Designed to integrate with file metadata management and playback control modules.

### Integration Notes

- This module operates independently of UI concerns and does not perform any rendering.
- Frontend UI components bind to bookmark data through observable states or callbacks.
- Works alongside the FileManagerModule to persist bookmarks as part of audio file metadata.
- Can be extended to support bookmark synchronization or cloud backup in future releases.

# Summary

The BookmarksModule backend forms a vital component of enhanced user experience by enabling rich, persistent bookmarks and user annotations within audio recordings. By cleanly separating bookmark management from UI and audio playback, it provides a maintainable and extensible framework supporting both current and future feature expansions.
