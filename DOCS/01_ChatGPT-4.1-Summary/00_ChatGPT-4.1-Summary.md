Here is a summary of the work completed in your iOS Dictaphone audio recorder project based on the detailed GPT5 UI specification and the Master TODO:

---

# Project Completion Summary

## Audio UI Components (A1-A7)

- **A1 Waveform and Timeline:**
  - Implemented live real-time waveform display visualizing RMS/peak audio data at â‰¥ 30 Hz smoothly.
  - Created vertical decibel level ruler and horizontal time ruler fully integrated for clear timeline feedback.

- **A2 Recording Information Panel:**
  - Displays live recording duration, file metadata, audio format, and dynamic L/R audio meters with clip indicators.
  - Supports accessibility and dynamic type.

- **A3 Navigation and Actions:**
  - Included Back, Home, T-MARK, and Options buttons with accessible interactions and callback support.

- **A4 Search and Filter Controls:**
  - Full-featured debounced search field, theme toggle, favorites filter, and waveform density control implemented and integrated.

- **A5 Transport Controls:**
  - Stop, Record/Pause toggle buttons with state-driven UI and blinking red recording indicator.

- **A6 Central Circular Playback Control:**
  - Custom circular segmented control implementing play/pause, seek back/forward, A-B looping, and playback rate cycling.

- **A7 UI Lock and Info Buttons:**
  - UI lock toggle with haptics and long-press unlocking gesture.
  - Info button stub for help sheet.

## Backend and Performance

- Offline waveform generation and caching implemented with automatic cache size management to optimize disk usage.
- Live waveform sample updates throttled to 30+ FPS for smooth UI rendering without jank.
- File list displays waveform previews efficiently with caching.

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- **QA1 Unit Tests:** Comprehensive XCTest coverage for core audio and UI logic, including ViewModel state transitions, waveform computations, and UI components helpers.
- **QA2 UI Tests:** XCUITest cases covering key user flows including recording, playback, searching, locking, and basic interaction stability.
- **QA3 Stress Testing:** Placeholder defined; additional automated and manual stress and endurance tests needed for full production readiness.

---

## Accessibility and Compliance

- Accessibility labels, hints, and roles annotated across UI elements.
- Dynamic Type scaling supported up to XXL sizes.
- Color contrast and interaction sizes meet accessibility standards.
- VoiceOver behavior enhanced with contextual announcements for key changes.

---

## Architecture and Patterns

- Strict MVVM architecture with immutable props and callback-driven views.
- ViewModel mediates audio engine data and UI interaction unidirectionally on @MainActor.
- Data binding uses Combine and async/await patterns where appropriate.
- SwiftUI view composition aligns with design specs for maintainability and testability.

---

# Next Steps Recommendations

- Extend QA3 stress and endurance tests for resilience verification under load.
- Implement detailed options/settings UI and modal help/info screens.
- Expand localization and theming support.
- Continue accessibility validation with manual device testing.
- Optimize performance profiling on real devices.
